<th> <p>GSAT,NAVIC,GPS system:</th>   


<th>The GSAT series of  geosynchronous satellites is a system developed by ISRO with an objective to make India self-reliant in broadcasting services. The system includes a total of 168 transponders (out of which 95 are leased out to provide services to broadcasters) in the C, Extended C and Ku bands, providing services to telecommunications, television broadcasting, weather forecasting, disaster warning and search and rescue operations.</th>

<th>Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS), with an operational name of NavIC (acronym for Navigation with Indian Constellation; also, nāvik 'sailor' or 'navigator' in Indian languages),is an autonomous regional satellite navigation system that provides accurate real-time positioning and timing services.It covers India and a region extending 1,500 km (930 mi) around it, with plans for further extension up to 3,000 km (1,900 mi).An extended service area lies between the primary service area and a rectangle area enclosed by the 30th parallel south to the 50th parallel north and the 30th meridian east to the 130th meridian east, 1,500–6,000 km (930–3,730 mi) beyond borders where some of the NavIC satellites are visible but the position is not always computable with assured accuracy. The system currently consists of a constellation of eight  satellites, with two additional satellites on ground as stand-by.</th>

<th>The Global Positioning System (GPS), originally Navstar GPS,is a satellite-based radio navigation system owned by the United States Space Force and operated by Mission Delta 31. It is one of the global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) that provide geolocation and time information to a GPS receiver anywhere on or near the Earth where there is an unobstructed line of sight to four or more GPS satellites.It does not require the user to transmit any data, and operates independently of any telephone or Internet reception, though these technologies can enhance the usefulness of the GPS positioning information.It provides critical positioning capabilities to military, civil, and commercial users around the world. Although the United States government created, controls, and maintains the GPS system, it is freely accessible to anyone with a GPS receiver.</th>
