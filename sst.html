<th> <p> People traveled to India from various parts of the world in ancient times:</th>


<th>Ibn Battuta entered India through the high mountains of Afghanistan, following the footsteps of Turkish warriors who, a century earlier, had conquered the Hindu farming people of India and established the Sultanate of Delhi. That first wave of Muslim soldiers looted towns and smashed the images of the gods of the Hindu worshippers. But later warrior kings set up a system to tax, rather than slaughter the peasants. They replaced the local Hindu leaders with Turks from Afghanistan and conquered and united a large area almost to the tip of the subcontinent. But these Muslim sultans in Delhi were not safe. They faced continued opposition from the Hindu majority in India who rebelled against their conquerors, and they were threatened with periodic Mongol invasions from the north. The Chagatay Khan (whom Ibn Battuta visited on his way to India) had invaded India and threatened Delhi, the new capital city about 1323. But the armies of the feisty Sultan Muhammad Tughluq in Delhi had chased them back across the Indus River.</th>

<th>Hiuen Tsang's visit to India was mainly aimed at acquiring awareness of Buddhism and collecting its religious texts. He slipped away from there in 629 A.D, as he did not get the permission of the Chinese emperor to visit India. He crossed the Gobi Desert, visited a number of Central Asian locations, including Kashagar, Samarkand and Balkha, and entered Afghanistan. He met and found worshippers of the Light, a great number of monks and adherents of Buddhism, Stupas and monasteries in various locations.

He reached Taxila from Afghanistan via Peshawar. He covered the journey from China to India in about a year. Then he lived for almost fourteen years in India. He went to Kashmir from Taxila and then visited a variety of places in India, including Mathura, Kannauj, Sravasti, Ayodhya, Kapilvastu, Kusinagara, Sarnath, Vaisali, Pataliputra, Rajagraha, Bodha-Gaya, and Nalanda.</th>
